<p> Hi there! I'm Madeleine. My nickname is Ada, which is why this website is called Ada's HTML. My friend Evangeline made up that nickname. Note: Ada is pronounced \'ā-də\ not \'a-də\. I strongly dislike it when people pronounce it \'a-də\. Anyways, enough about my nickname. Let's name five random (superrrr random) facts about me. 
<p>1. I have never had a nickname I actually liked before "Ada."</p>
<p>2. I like to use my stuffed animal (or vegetable if you like) Cilantro (an avocado) as a pillow.</p>
<p>3. I put a homemade sticker on my headphones.</p>
<p>4. My redpoint in bouldering is V0 (the easiest level).</p>
<p>5. I strongly dislike Charmin toliet paper advertisements.</p>

<h3><center>The Wrapping Paper</center></h3>
<h5><center>By Madeleine H. - Adapted from a short from the show Anamaniacs</center></h5>
<p>Five year old Eva tore open her birthday gift. Her eyes grew wide as she saw the doll inside. Her dad took the shiny wrapping paper and box and threw it into the waste bin.</p>
<p>Lucy screamed. What was this crazy place? she thought. The plastic box above squished her and the scratchy parchment below poked her back. And what were those teeny black shavings that marked everywhere on her?</p>
<p>Lucy fell asleep.</p>
<p>After a couple of days with the black shavings and the scrap paper, she was getting moved! Lucy was so excited she could hardly contain herself! But all hope was lost when she was thrown into a deep, dark bag with even more paper, but worst yet, there was a banana peel inside with her.</p>
<p>She struggled to move to the top of the bag as it was getting dragged across the floor by a grumbling boy. Lucy got so seasick that she felt she was about to throw up. Lucy didn’t think it could get any worse, but the whole bag was thrown up into the air and crash landed inside a stinky box.</p>
<p>Finally, the trouble was over. Even though it smelled bad, she didn’t have motion sickness. Lucy took a nap.</p>
<p>When Lucy was awoken, she felt herself falling to the floor and heard loud beeps. <i>Wait, is this the landfill?</i> she asked herself. Lucy had heard rumours about this horrendous place, but she never believed in them.</p>
<p>Lucy sat in the stinky landfill for days. But finally, the wind picked up and she blew across the city and landed on a jungle gym in Central Park.</p>
<p>Matthew was running across a shaky bridge when a gold glint caught his eye. He ran over to the swing set to take it. It was beautiful. It would be perfect for the lollipop that I got for Mellie, he thought.</p>
<p>Matthew carefully wrapped up the lollipop while his father went to the soup shop, hopefully to get a free dinner. After dinner, Matthew gave his little birthday present to Mellie. Her eyes grew wide when she saw the lollipop and then hugged her brother. She carefully folded up the paper and put it in her pocket.</p>
<p>Lucy sighed contentedly. She was finally in the hands of someone who cared.</p>
